          In the heart of Sedona, where red rocks meet boundless sky, a remarkable story is taking shapeâ€”one 
          that weaves together the forgotten threads of five extraordinary women whose lives and legacies have 
          shaped this community. The Dead Quilter's Society isn't just a production; it's a movement to preserve 
          history, celebrate female resilience, and share Sedona's unique cultural heritage with the world.
